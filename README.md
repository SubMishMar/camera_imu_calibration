Camera IMU Calibration using an Extended Kalman Filter

A test dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_81oRKSG5lR9X9jL3swOfnvJNi_wb-Xq/view?usp=sharing)

Make sure to set the correct path to bag file in the launch file.

This repository is our implementation of the Camera-IMU calibration paper [A Kalman filter-based algorithm for IMU-camera calibration by Faraz M Mirzaei, Stergios I Roumeliotis](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4637877).
